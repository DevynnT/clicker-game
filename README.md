# clicker-game

Game made in Python using CodeSkultptor 2.0 for my Programming 11 class in high school. Game was originally made in November 2019.

## How to Run

Go to https://py2.codeskulptor.org/ and paste all the code from `init.py` and hit run.

## Issues

Code base has not been updated since January 2020.
- Many images will not load.
- Lots of functions are based on FPS, going above 60 or below 30 will yield unexpected results.
